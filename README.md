# BetterSleeping
A Spigot plugin that will make sleeping on servers less of a hassle

# What this plugin does

BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Config files are included and allow the percentage and messages to be customised. A reload command is also included to reload all config files on the fly.

This plugin is functional and has been testend on Spigot 1.12.2 and Spigot 1.13.1.
