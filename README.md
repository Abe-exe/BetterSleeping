# BetterSleeping (20.000+ downloads!)
A Spigot plugin that will make sleeping on servers less of a hassle. More information can be found on the [Spigot plugin page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bettersleeping-1-12-1-13.60837/ "BetterSleeping's plugin page"). For a guide, please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/wiki).

## What this plugin does
Usually all players must sleep before a night/storm can be skipped on a multiplayer server.
BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Quite extensive configuration is included to suit your needs. The configuration includes, but is not limited to:
 - Set a **percentage** of players that must sleep to skip the night
 - All messages can be **customised** in lang.yml
 - Give players **buffs** (potion effects) for sleeping
 - **Disable phantoms**
 - Display **messages on screen** instead of in the chat
 - ... And **so much more**! Check the [configuration wiki](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/wiki/Configuration) to see all options. 

## Tested Spigot versions
This plugin is functional and has been tested on several Spigot versions. Bukkit should be compatible too but no extensive testing has been done. You can see the **latest** and **tested** BetterSleeping version for every supported Spigot version in the table below. Newer updates than the mentioned BetterSleeping versions may still be fully compatible but have not been tested (yet). Previous versions of BetterSleeping can be found in the [Versions folder](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/tree/master/Versions).
