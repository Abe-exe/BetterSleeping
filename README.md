# BetterSleeping (13700+ downloads!)
A Spigot plugin that will make sleeping on servers less of a hassle. More information can be found on the [Spigot plugin page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bettersleeping-1-12-1-13.60837/ "BetterSleeping's plugin page"). For a guide, please visit our [wiki](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/wiki).

## What this plugin does
Normally all players must sleep before a night/storm can be skipped on a multiplayer server.
BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Config files are included and allow the percentage and messages to be customised. A reload command is also included to reload all config files on the fly. 

## Tested Spigot versions
This plugin is functional and has been tested on several Spigot versions. Bukkit should be compatible too but no extensive testing has been done. You can see the latest **tested** BetterSleeping version for every supported Spigot version in the table below. Newer updates than the mentioned BetterSleeping versions may still be fully compatible but just have not been tested (yet).
