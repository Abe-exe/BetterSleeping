# BetterSleeping (2200+ downloads!)
A Spigot plugin that will make sleeping on servers less of a hassle. More information can be found on the [Spigot plugin page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bettersleeping-1-12-1-13.60837/ "BetterSleeping's plugin page").

## What this plugin does
Normally all players must sleep before a night/storm can be skipped on a multiplayer server.
BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Config files are included and allow the percentage and messages to be customised. A reload command is also included to reload all config files on the fly. 

## Tested Spigot versions
This plugin is functional and has been tested on Spigot 1.12, Spigot 1.13 and Spigot 1.14.
