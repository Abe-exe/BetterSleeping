# These are effects that will be applied after sleeping, only on the players that have slept
# The idea is to give a well rested bonus so sleeping is encouraged

# CONFIGURATION GUIDE:
# To disable an effect, set its time to 0 or simply remove it from the list
# Not all in-game effects are included so adding options outside of the list below is not supported:
