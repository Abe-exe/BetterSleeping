# Set the percentage of online players that need to be sleeping 
# in order to skip the night/storm.
# Default: 30
percentage_needed: 30

# Set the time (in ticks) that players will have to remain in their beds 
# as soon as enough people are sleeping.
# A delay of one second is equal to 20 ticks so setting this to 40 means a delay of two seconds
# Default: 40
sleep_delay: 40

# Choose whether BetterSleeping should treat every world seperate from eachother (true)
#       percentage_needed:  30 would mean that 30% of all players IN WORLD X should be sleeping
#                           If this condition is met, the night/storm will ONLY be skipped in that same world
#           Example:        There are 100 online players, 90 in the End and 10 in the Overworld.
#                           3 people are sleeping in the Overworld and since 30% of people in that world are sleeping
#                           The night will be skipped, but ONLY in the Overworld
# Or if it should count the global number of sleeping players and skip the night/storm in all worlds (false)
#       percentage_needed:  30 would mean that 30% of all ONLINE players should be sleeping
#                           If this condition is met, the night/storm will be skipped in EVERY world
#           Example:        There are 100 online players, 90 in the End and 10 in the Overworld.
#                           30 people (of all worlds combined) must be sleeping in order to skip the night/storm.
#                           The night/storm will be skipped in EVERY world!!
# Default: false
world_specific_behavior: false
