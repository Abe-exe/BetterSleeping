-The 'cancelled'-message will no longer be sent when it shouldn't be sent in the first place
-Fixed a console error when people sleep in different worlds with world_specific_behavior set to true. If the same issue still occurrs, BetterSleeping will try to fix its status along with sending a custom message to the console instead of an error.
-Made sure that BetterSleeping is loaded AFTER the worlds
-Removed Freddy Krueger
-Enough_players_sleeping will no longer be repeated when additional players start sleeping after enough people were sleeping already

Planned features (some/all may still be canceled):
-Implement unit testing
-Refactor the language system
-Give players (configurable) temporary buffs for sleeping (Healing, filling food bar, speed)
-Tab auto complete for /bettersleeping reload
-Report every missing language option instead of just reporting the most important ones
-Automatic punishments for people that try to spam the chat with BetterSleeping messages (kick, ban,..)
