DUE TO A NAMING ISSUE IN v1.3.2, v1.4.0 WILL BE SKIPPED

The biggest update so far!

-Fixed a bug where BetterSleeping would throw errors when world_specific_behavior was set to true
-Players seemed able to 'sleep' during the day and skip the night regardless of the time, spamming the chat as a result. 'Sleeping' during the day will no longer be treated as sleeping by BetterSleeping (also reducing spam to some extent).
-Fixed an issue where one player could trick BetterSleeping into thinking that multiple players were sleeping when world_specific_behavior was set to true
-Preventing spam: After leaving a bed, a player must wait 10 seconds (default) before they can sleep again. This delay can be set in config.yml
-A switch from true to false (and the other way around) of world_specific_behavior will now be enforced upon /bettersleeping reload or regular reload/restart meaning the behavior can be changed on the fly!
-Corrected the version in plugin.yml
-'Resetting file'-messages will no longer be printed to the console on first load
-Cleaned the project files on GitHub: no more useless files!
-Fixed a bug where the settings were loaded twice upon reload
-BetterSleeping will report missing options when generating a new config/language file
-Lang.yml now uses & instead of § since the latter may not be copied succesfully to the server
-Fixed an issue where all messages and settings were null, regardless of the settings
-Fixed an issue where the settings were loaded multiple times instead of once


Planned features (some/all may still be canceled):
-Implement unit testing
-Refactor the language system
-Give players (configurable) temporary buffs for sleeping (Healing, filling food bar, speed)
-Tab auto complete for /bettersleeping reload
-Report every missing language option instead of just reporting the most important ones
-Automatic punishments for people that try to spam the chat with BetterSleeping messages (kick, ban,..)
