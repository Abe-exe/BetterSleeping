-BetterSleeping was completely rewritten, improving maintainability a lot
	-'World_specific_behavior' is now called 'multiworld_support'
	-Configuration was rebuilt, became more modular and has a better structure altogether
	-Adding configuration options will be much easier from now on
	-Added an in-built debugging system, for developer use only
	-Multiworld mode and regular mode now use the same core systems
	-The option 'multiworld_support' Is now true by default
	-Unit testing has been implemented, by using PowerMockito
	-Players can now be given the time they have to wait before they can sleep again ('sleep_spam')

TO DO:
-Improve the ConfigAPI further (the biggest part has been written in a seperate project already)

(Potentially) planned features:
-Implement unit testing
-Give players (configurable) temporary buffs for sleeping (Healing, filling food bar, speed)
-Tab auto complete for /bettersleeping reload
-Add a command shortcut (like /bs reload)
-Automatic punishments for people that try to spam the chat with BetterSleeping messages (kick, ban,..)
