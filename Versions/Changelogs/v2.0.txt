-BetterSleeping was completely rewritten, improving maintainability a lot
	-'World_specific_behavior' is now called 'multiworld_support'
	-Configuration was rebuilt, became more modular and has a better structure altogether
	-Adding configuration options will be much easier from now on
	-Added an in-built debugging system, for developer use only
	-Multiworld mode and regular mode now use the same core systems
	-The option 'multiworld_support' Is now true by default
	-Unit testing has been implemented, by using PowerMockito
	-Players are now given the time they have to wait before they can sleep again (in 'sleep_spam', with '<time>')
	-Merged OnSleepEventGlobal and OnSleepEventLocal to reduce duplicate code, the funcionality was maintained
	-The default 'cancelled'-message has been changed and includes the amount of extra players that are required
	-Removed 'good morning'- and 'good night'-messages on startup/poweroff


TO DO:
-Improve the ConfigAPI further (the biggest part has been written in a seperate project already)


(Potentially) planned features:
-Give players (configurable) temporary buffs for sleeping (Healing, filling food bar, speed,...)
-Give players (configurable) temporary debuffs for not sleeping (Poison, mining fatigue, slowness...)
-Tab auto complete for /bettersleeping reload
-Add a command shortcut (like /bs reload)
-Add the ability for players to disable a specific message
-Will not be implemented: Automatic punishments (felt redundant since players are not able to spam chat like that anymore)
