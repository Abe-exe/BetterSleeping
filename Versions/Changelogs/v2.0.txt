-BetterSleeping was completely rewritten, improving maintainability a lot
	-The built-in reload system was simplified
	-'/bs reload' can now be used too, and has the same effect as /bettersleeping reload
	-Tab auto complete has been implemented for /bettersleeping reload
	-Configuration was rebuilt, became more modular and has a better structure altogether
		-Adding configuration options will be much easier from now on
		-'World_specific_behavior' is now called 'multiworld_support'
		-The option 'multiworld_support' is now true by default
		-The default 'cancelled'-message has been changed and includes the amount of extra players that are required
		-Players are now given the time they have to wait before they can sleep again (in 'sleep_spam', with '<time>')
		-If a configuration option is not found, the default option will be loaded from within the jar file
	-Multiworld mode and regular mode were rewritten and now use the same core systems
	-Added an in-built debugging system, for developer use only
	-Unit testing has been implemented, by using PowerMockito but is not being used yet
	-Merged OnSleepEventGlobal and OnSleepEventLocal to reduce duplicate code, the funcionality was maintained
	-Removed 'good morning'- and 'good night'-messages on startup/poweroff
	-A whole bunch of bugs were fixed (this was at least 50% of the work)
		-Old bugs were fixed by rewriting pretty much everything
		-New bugs were introduced (as expected), except for the list below, all of them were fixed
		-Even had to battle bugs that crawled into the plugin because of default Minecraft/Spigot mechanics
	-Removed Freddy Krueger

KNOWN ISSUES
- if config.yml and lang.yml are missing, /bs reload will throw an error
- Only if a storm (not night) is skipped: There is a slight delay before a players leave their bed automatically. This can currently not be patched.
- The following occurs if a player has been waiting to skip the night for a while (screen is darkened) and suddenly all online players get in their bed:
  The default Minecraft/Spigot mechanic takes over and skips the night instantly. This has partially been patched by acting quicker than this default mechanic.
  This does mean that the 'sleep_delay' in config.yml will be ignored in this instance. This can not be fixed, the alternative is people getting wrong messages from the plugin and the night being skipped instantly regardless.

TO DO:
-Improve the ConfigAPI further (the biggest part has been written in a seperate project already)
-Further optimization

(Potentially) planned features:
-Expand 'enough_sleeping' in lang.yml to include how long the players have to wait (dependent on 'sleep_delay' in config.yml)
-If there are missing configuration options, reporting them to the console on startup might be interesting. Right now, default values are used but no notifications are sent.
-Add an option to show messages on screen but not in the chat, will be added but need to figure out a way to make the messages fit on the screen.
-Give players (configurable) temporary buffs for sleeping (Healing, filling food bar, speed,...)
-Give players (configurable) temporary debuffs for not sleeping (Poison, mining fatigue, slowness, spawn monster...)
-Add the ability for players to disable a specific message (command for players, something like: /bs hide message_name)

Will not be implemented (removed from planned features):
-Automatic punishments (felt redundant since players are not able to spam chat like that anymore)
